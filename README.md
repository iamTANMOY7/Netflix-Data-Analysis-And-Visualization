# EDA ON NETFLIX DATA:

## ABOUT THE PROJECT:

## Introduction:

Netflix is a popular online streaming platform with a wide variety of movies and TV shows. 
This EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project is focused on analyzing the Netflix dataset using Python's pandas,
seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. The goal is to gain insights into the Netflix data, and answer some interesting questions related 
to the movies and TV shows on the platform.

## Data:

The Netflix dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. 
It contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2021. 
The dataset includes attributes such as title, director, cast, release year, rating, duration, and country of origin.

## Data Cleaning:

The dataset contained missing values that were handled by dropping any row containing a missing value. 
Some columns were also converted to the appropriate data type, and certain columns were split into multiple columns for better analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:

The following questions were explored using the Netflix dataset:

What are the top genres of movies and TV shows on Netflix?
Which countries produce the most content on Netflix?
How has the number of movies and TV shows on Netflix changed over the years?
What are the most popular ratings on Netflix?
What is the distribution of movie durations on Netflix?

## Visualization:

The seaborn and matplotlib libraries were used to create various visualizations to support the EDA. 
Some of the plots created include bar charts, pie charts, countplots, and boxplots.

## Conclusion:
The Netflix EDA project provided insights into the movies and TV shows on Netflix. 
It was observed that Drama, Comedy, and Action are the top genres on the platform, with the United States producing the most content.
The number of movies on Netflix has increased significantly in recent years, with the 2010s being the decade with the most movie releases.
TV shows, on the other hand, have been more consistently released over time. 
TV-MA is the most popular rating on Netflix, and the majority of movies on the platform have a duration of 90-120 minutes.

Overall, the project demonstrated the power of exploratory data analysis in providing insights into large datasets,
and how visualizations can aid in communicating these insights.
